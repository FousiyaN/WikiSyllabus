# Fire Engineering Fundamentals

## Course Objectives  
1. To provide an overview of fire science principles and fundamentals of fire behavior.  
2. To introduce the concepts of fire dynamics, combustion processes, and heat transfer mechanisms in fire situations.  
3. To develop understanding of ignition, flame spread, and fire growth in different environments.  
4. To familiarize students with fire detection, suppression, and extinguishing principles.  
5. To apply fire fundamentals in analyzing risks and planning preventive strategies for engineering applications.
