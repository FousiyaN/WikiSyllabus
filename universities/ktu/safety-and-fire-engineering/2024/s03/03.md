# Fluid Mechanics

## Course Objectives  
1. To introduce the fundamental properties of fluids and basic principles of fluid statics and dynamics.  
2. To understand fluid flow phenomena, measurement techniques, and governing equations.  
3. To develop the ability to apply Bernoulli’s principle and conservation laws in fluid systems.  
4. To analyze pipe flow, losses, and design of fluid transport systems.  
5. To provide exposure to fluid machinery and its applications in fire and safety engineering.
